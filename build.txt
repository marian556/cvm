This project is a customizable,  lightweight and fast C like general purpose virtual machine and scripting language with 
fast binding/calls to C/C++.

For the language motivation and the features see readme.txt.

You can import this project folder into eclipse on ubuntu.

This was tested:
Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers
Version: Oxygen.2 Release (4.7.2)
Build id: 20171218-0600
OS: Linux, v.4.15.0-33-generic, x86_64 / gtk 3.22.30, WebKit 2.20.5

or alternatively you can use makefile system with 'make' command bellow:

Note: This is an experimental work in progress project that in current state will not work on Windows with Visual Studio 
compiler due to lack of "calculated goto" language feature in windows compiler. 
Only tested on GNU/Linux/ubuntu 18.04.01 LTS (bionic) with 64 bit g++ (Ubuntu 7.3.0-16ubuntu3) 7.3.0

This project uses boost/spirit X3 parser in an essential way. Project was tested on boost 1.69.0 
(you may want to use and you can try to use your default system version of boost first)
and is compiled with C++17.

marian@ubuntu:~$wget https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.69.0/source/boost_1_69_0.tar.bz2
marian@ubuntu:~$ tar xvjf boost_1_69_0.tar.bz2

...Project is heavily adapted and extended from example calc9 in boost documentation:

/usr/share/doc/libboost1.65-doc/examples/libs/spirit/example/x3/calc/calc9/
...or..

~/boost_1_69_0/libs/spirit/example/x3/calc/calc9/

...although spirit X3 parser is header only if you don't use your system boost you need to 
...proceed building boost,because we need boost_chrono and boost_filesystem at least to build...
...you may have to configure your build system to include boost include path...
...g++ -std=c++17 -I/home/marian/boost_1_69_0 ....

marian@ubuntu:~/cvm$cd Release

...you do only once build
marian@ubuntu:~/cvm/Release$make
...cvm binary should appear in this folder..

marian@ubuntu:~/cvm/Release$cd ../examples

...example output...

marian@ubuntu:~/cvm/examples$ ../Release/cvm   bisec_sqrt7_func.cvm
output of sqrt(7.0)=2.645751311064591 iter=1000000 time=1422746855ns

marian@ubuntu:~/cvm/examples$ ../Release/cvm  -o bisec_sqrt7_func.cvm
output of sqrt(7.0)=2.645751311064591 iter=1000000 time=795718714ns
